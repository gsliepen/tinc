It looks like this might be the last release before 1.0.


version 1.0pre4              Jan 17 2001

* Updated documentation; the documentation now reflects the
  configuration as it is.

* Some internal changes to make tinc scale better for large
  networks, such as using AVL trees instead of linked lists for the
  connection list.  

* RSA keys can be stored in separate files if needed.  See the
  documentation for more information.

* tinc has now been reported to run on Linux PowerPC and FreeBSD x86.



version 1.0pre3              Oct 31 2000

* The protocol has been redesigned, and although some details are
  still under discussion, this is secure.  Care has been taken to
  resist most, if not all, attacks.
  
* Unfortunately this protocol is not compatible with earlier versions,
  nor are earlier versions compatible with this version.  Because the
  older protocol has huge security flaws, we feel that not
  implementing backwards compatibility is justified.

* Some data about the protocol:

  * It uses public/private RSA keys for authentication (this is the
    actual fix for the security hole).

  * All cryptographic functions have been taken out of tinc, instead
    it uses the OpenSSL library functions.

  * Offers support for multiple subnets per tinc daemon.

* New is also the support for the universal tun/tap device.  This
  means better portability to FreeBSD and Solaris.

* tinc is tested to compile on Solaris, Linux x86, Linux alpha.

* tinc now uses the OpenSSL library for cryptographic operations.
  More information on getting and installing OpenSSL is in the manual.
  This also means that the GMP library is no longer required.

* Further, thanks to Enrique Zanardi, we have Spanish messages; Matias
  Carrasco provided us with a Spanish translation of the manual.


What still needs to be done before 1.0:

* Documentation.  Especially since the protocol has changed, and a lot
  of configuration directives have been added.




version 1.0pre2              May 31 2000

* This version has been internationalized; and a Dutch translation has          
  been included.                                                                
                                                                                
* Two configuration variables have been added:                                  
  * VpnMask - the IP network mask for the entire VPN, not just our              
    subnet (as given by MyVirtualIP).  The Redhat and Debian packages           
    use this variable in their system startup scripts, but it is                
    ignored by tinc.                                                            
  * Hostnames - if set to `yes', look up the names of IP addresses              
    trying to connect to us.  Default set to `no', to prevent lockups           
    during lookups.                                                             
                                                                                
* The system startup scripts for Debian and Redhat use                          
  /etc/tinc/nets.boot to find out which networks need to be started             
  during system boot.                                                           
                                                                                
* Fixes to prevent denial of service attacks by sending random data             
  after connecting (and even when the connection has been established),         
  either random garbage or just nonsensical protocol fields.                    
                                                                                
* tinc will retry to connect upon startup, does not quit if it doesn't          
  work the first time.                                                          
                                                                                
* Hosts that are disconnected implicitly if we lose a connection get            
  deleted from the internal list, to prevent hogging eachother with             
  add and delete requests when the connection is restored.                      
                                                                                
                                                                                
What still needs to be done before 1.0:                                         
                                                                                
* Documentation.                                                                
* Failover ConnectTo lines, try another one if the first doesn't work.
