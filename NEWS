Version 1.1pre2              Juli 17 2011

 * .cookie files are renamed to .pid files, which are compatible with 1.0.x.

 * Experimental protocol enhancements that can be enabled with the option
   ExperimentalProtocol = yes:

   * Ephemeral ECDH key exchange will be used for both the meta protocol and
     UDP session keys.
   * Key exchanges are signed with ECDSA.
   * ECDSA public keys are automatically exchanged after RSA authentication if
     nodes do not know each other's ECDSA public key yet.

Version 1.1pre1              June 25 2011

 * Control interface allows control of a running tinc daemon. Used by:
   * tincctl, a commandline utility
   * tinc-gui, a preliminary GUI implemented in Python/wxWidgets

 * Code cleanups and reorganization. 

 * Repleacable cryptography backend, currently supports OpenSSL and libgcrypt.

 * Use libevent to handle I/O events and timeouts.

 * Use splay trees instead of AVL trees to manage internal datastructures.

 Thanks to Scott Lamb and Sven-Haegar Koch for their contributions to this
 version of tinc.

Version 1.0.13               Apr 11 2010

 * Allow building tinc without LZO and/or Zlib.

 * Clamp MSS of TCP packets in both directions.

 * Experimental StrictSubnets, Forwarding and DirectOnly options,
   giving more control over information and packets received from/sent to other
   nodes.

 * Ensure tinc never sends symbolic names for ports over the wire.

Version 1.0.12               Feb  3 2010

 * Really allow fast roaming of hosts to other nodes in a switched VPN.

 * Fixes missing or incorrect environment variables when calling host-up/down
   and subnet-up/down scripts in some cases.

 * Allow port to be specified in Address statements.

 * Clamp MSS of TCP packets to the discovered path MTU.

 * Let two nodes behind NAT learn each others current UDP address and port via
   a third node, potentially allowing direct communications in a similar way to
   STUN.

Version 1.0.11               Nov  1 2009

 * Fixed potential crash when the HUP signal is sent.

 * Fixes handling of weighted Subnets in switch and hub modes, preventing
   unnecessary broadcasts.

   back to TCP unnecessarily.

 * Allow fast roaming of hosts to other nodes in a switched VPN.

Version 1.0.10               Oct 18 2009

 * Fixed potential crashes during shutdown and (in rare conditions) when other
   nodes disconnected from the VPN.

 * Improved NAT handling: tinc now copes with mangled port numbers, and will
   automatically fall back to TCP if direct UDP connection between nodes is not
   possible. The TCPOnly option should not have to be used anymore.

 * Allow configuration files with CRLF line endings to be read on UNIX.

 * Disable old RSA keys when generating new ones, and raise the default size of
   new RSA keys to 2048 bits.

 * Many fixes in the path MTU discovery code, especially when Compression is
   being used.

 * Tinc can now drop privileges and/or chroot itself.

 * The TunnelServer code now just ignores information from clients instead of
   disconnecting them.

 * Improved performance on Windows by using the new ProcessPriority option and
   by making the handling of packets received from the TAP-Win32 adapter more
   efficient.

 * Code cleanups: tinc now follows the C99 standard, copyright headers have
   been updated to include patch authors, checkpoint tracing and localisation
   features have been removed.

 * Support for (jailbroken) iPhone and iPod Touch has been added.

 Thanks to Florian Forster, Grzegorz Dymarek and especially Michael Tokarev for
 their contributions to this version of tinc.

It looks like this might be the last release before 1.0.


version 1.0pre4              Jan 17 2001

* Updated documentation; the documentation now reflects the
  configuration as it is.

* Some internal changes to make tinc scale better for large
  networks, such as using AVL trees instead of linked lists for the
  connection list.  

* RSA keys can be stored in separate files if needed.  See the
  documentation for more information.

* tinc has now been reported to run on Linux PowerPC and FreeBSD x86.



version 1.0pre3              Oct 31 2000

* The protocol has been redesigned, and although some details are
  still under discussion, this is secure.  Care has been taken to
  resist most, if not all, attacks.
  
* Unfortunately this protocol is not compatible with earlier versions,
  nor are earlier versions compatible with this version.  Because the
  older protocol has huge security flaws, we feel that not
  implementing backwards compatibility is justified.

* Some data about the protocol:

  * It uses public/private RSA keys for authentication (this is the
    actual fix for the security hole).

  * All cryptographic functions have been taken out of tinc, instead
    it uses the OpenSSL library functions.

  * Offers support for multiple subnets per tinc daemon.

* New is also the support for the universal tun/tap device.  This
  means better portability to FreeBSD and Solaris.

* tinc is tested to compile on Solaris, Linux x86, Linux alpha.

* tinc now uses the OpenSSL library for cryptographic operations.
  More information on getting and installing OpenSSL is in the manual.
  This also means that the GMP library is no longer required.

* Further, thanks to Enrique Zanardi, we have Spanish messages; Matias
  Carrasco provided us with a Spanish translation of the manual.


What still needs to be done before 1.0:

* Documentation.  Especially since the protocol has changed, and a lot
  of configuration directives have been added.




version 1.0pre2              May 31 2000

* This version has been internationalized; and a Dutch translation has          
  been included.                                                                
                                                                                
* Two configuration variables have been added:                                  
  * VpnMask - the IP network mask for the entire VPN, not just our              
    subnet (as given by MyVirtualIP).  The Redhat and Debian packages           
    use this variable in their system startup scripts, but it is                
    ignored by tinc.                                                            
  * Hostnames - if set to `yes', look up the names of IP addresses              
    trying to connect to us.  Default set to `no', to prevent lockups           
    during lookups.                                                             
                                                                                
* The system startup scripts for Debian and Redhat use                          
  /etc/tinc/nets.boot to find out which networks need to be started             
  during system boot.                                                           
                                                                                
* Fixes to prevent denial of service attacks by sending random data             
  after connecting (and even when the connection has been established),         
  either random garbage or just nonsensical protocol fields.                    
                                                                                
* tinc will retry to connect upon startup, does not quit if it doesn't          
  work the first time.                                                          
                                                                                
* Hosts that are disconnected implicitly if we lose a connection get            
  deleted from the internal list, to prevent hogging eachother with             
  add and delete requests when the connection is restored.                      
                                                                                
                                                                                
What still needs to be done before 1.0:                                         
                                                                                
* Documentation.                                                                
* Failover ConnectTo lines, try another one if the first doesn't work.
